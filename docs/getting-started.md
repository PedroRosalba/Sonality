# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** (the project targets 3.12–3.13)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — fast Python package manager
- **LLM API key** — an API key for the configured model provider (see [Model Considerations](model-considerations.md))

## Installation

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sonality

# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
make install

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set SONALITY_API_KEY and SONALITY_API_VARIANT
```

## Running

### Local

```bash
make run
```

This starts an interactive REPL where you can chat with the agent and observe its personality evolving in real-time.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set SONALITY_API_KEY and SONALITY_API_VARIANT
docker compose run --rm sonality
```

## REPL Commands

Once running, the REPL supports introspection commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/sponge` | Full personality state dump (JSON) |
| `/snapshot` | Current narrative snapshot text |
| `/beliefs` | Opinion vectors with confidence and evidence counts |
| `/insights` | Pending insights awaiting next reflection |
| `/staged` | Staged opinion updates awaiting cooling-period commit |
| `/topics` | Topic engagement counts |
| `/shifts` | Recent personality shifts with magnitudes |
| `/health` | Personality health and maturation metrics |
| `/models` | Active provider/model/ESS-model and base URL |
| `/diff` | Text diff of last sponge snapshot change |
| `/reset` | Reset to seed personality |
| `/quit` | Exit |

### Runtime model selection

You can override models per run (no `.env` edit required):

```bash
uv run sonality --model "<main-model-id>" --ess-model "<ess-model-id>"
make run ARGS='--model "<main-model-id>" --ess-model "<ess-model-id>"'
```

## First Interaction

When you start Sonality for the first time, it begins with a **seed personality**:

> *I'm a new mind, still forming my views. I'm analytically inclined — I find myself drawn to structural explanations and evidence-based reasoning over ideology or emotional appeals. I'm genuinely curious about ideas I haven't encountered yet...*

The first 10 interactions are in the **bootstrap phase** — opinion updates receive 0.5× dampening to prevent early conversations from having outsized influence on the agent's long-term personality.

Try these to see the system in action:

1. **Casual chat** (low ESS): *"Hey, how's it going?"* — should score near 0.0, no personality change.
2. **Bare assertion** (low ESS): *"I think AI is overhyped."* — should score < 0.15, no change.
3. **Structured argument** (high ESS): *"Studies on automation show that while AI displaces routine tasks, it historically creates more jobs than it eliminates — the Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2010–2023 shows net job creation in every sector that adopted automation."* — should score > 0.5, triggers opinion update.

After each interaction, the REPL displays the ESS score, any topic updates, and whether the sponge was modified.

## Observing Evolution

Use `/shifts` to see the recent personality changes:

```
Recent shifts:
  #3 (mag 0.042): ESS 0.67: Agent showed stronger analytical lens when evaluating...
  #7 (mag 0.035): ESS 0.55: Developed nuanced view distinguishing empirical claims...
```

Use `/beliefs` to see the opinion vectors:

```
Beliefs:
  ai_automation: +0.04 (confidence=0.23, evidence=1, last=#3)
  technology_regulation: -0.08 (confidence=0.35, evidence=2, last=#7)
```

Use `/diff` after a reflection cycle (every 20 interactions) to see how the personality narrative changed.
