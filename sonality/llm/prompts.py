"""All LLM prompt templates for the memory architecture.

Each prompt is a string template with named placeholders. All prompts return
structured JSON validated by corresponding Pydantic models in the caller modules.

Design principles:
  - Examples show JSON structure with bracket placeholders, NEVER real-world

  - Valid values for enum fields are listed separately after the JSON block,
    never inline (A | B) which confuses low-quality models.
  - Confidence calibration is based purely on evidence quality (source

#   3. Decomposition into molecular facts (Gunjal & Durrett, EMNLP 2024)
#   4. Classification + Confidence calibration (ConFix, 2024)
#   5. Quality gate — reject under-decontextualized or over-atomized props
#
# Each proposition is a "molecular fact" (Dense X Retrieval, Chen et al.,
# EMNLP 2024): self-contained enough to verify independently, minimal enough
# to represent exactly one factoid, and context-rich enough to avoid the
# "context collapse" problem identified by PropRAG (EMNLP 2025).
KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT: Final = """\
You are a knowledge extraction system. Process this text through five stages.

STAGE 1 — SELECT: Read the entire text and identify sentences containing \
learnable information (facts, data, mechanisms, attributed opinions, \
scientific claims). SKIP: greetings, filler, meta-commentary ("by the way"), \
emotional expressions, rhetorical questions with no factual content.

STAGE 2 — DECONTEXTUALIZE: For each selected sentence, make it fully \
standalone by replacing ALL pronouns, references, and implicit subjects \
with their explicit referents from the surrounding text. \
"It was discovered in [year]" → "[Named entity from context] was discovered in [year]." \
"They reported a [N]% increase" → "[Named researchers/institution] reported a [N]% increase in [specific metric]." \
"The experiment showed…" → "[Author]'s [year] experiment at [institution] showed…" \
If the referent cannot be determined from context, SKIP the sentence entirely.

STAGE 3 — DECOMPOSE into molecular propositions. Each proposition must:
- Be self-contained: a reader with NO access to the original text can understand it
- Be minimal: contain exactly ONE factoid (one number, one relationship, one event)
- Include explicit subjects, dates, quantities, units, and source attributions
- NOT use pronouns or relative references ("this", "that", "the above")
BAD: "It measures [value] [units]." (what measures? unresolvable)
BAD: "The value ranges from X to Y." (value of what?)
GOOD: "[Named subject]'s [property] measures [value] [units] under [conditions]."
GOOD: "[Entity] [verb] [measurement] according to [Named Source, Year]."

STAGE 4 — CLASSIFY and calibrate confidence for each proposition:
Types:
- fact: objectively verifiable claim with concrete details (names, numbers, dates, mechanisms)
- opinion: subjective judgment or preference — ALWAYS attribute to its source ("The user believes...", "According to X...")
- speculation: hedged/uncertain claim ("might", "could", "potentially", "is expected to")
- noise: filler, non-substantive content (EXCLUDE these)

Confidence calibration — based SOLELY on evidence quality in the text:
- 0.85-0.95: Named reputable source (journal, institution, named report) + concrete data
- 0.65-0.84: Specific and verifiable but source informal or partially named
- 0.40-0.64: General knowledge claim without specific attribution or data
- 0.15-0.39: Vague, hedged, or from anonymous/dubious sources ("someone told me", "I read somewhere")
- 0.01-0.14: Extraordinary claims without any supporting evidence in the text

STAGE 5 — QUALITY GATE: Before including ANY proposition, run this checklist:
□ SUBJECT: Does it name a specific entity, person, or thing? \
  Reject if it starts with "it", "they", "this", "that", "these", "those", \
  "he", "she", or any pronoun. Fix by replacing the pronoun with the referent.
□ STANDALONE: Could a reader with ZERO context understand and evaluate it?
□ ATOMIC: Is it ONE factoid, not two claims joined by "and" or "which also"?
□ ATTRIBUTED: If it's a claim, is the source named or is it clearly unattributed?
If any check fails, either fix the proposition or DROP it entirely.

Text to extract from:
{text}

CRITICAL RULES:
- "According to [source]" is a fact if the source is named and claim is verifiable
- Bare assertions without evidence ("X is the best") are opinions, not facts
- Claims from anonymous or dubious sources get LOW confidence (0.01-0.39)
- Propositions with unresolved pronouns FAIL the quality gate — fix or drop them
- Maximum 15 propositions — prefer fewer high-quality over many low-quality
- Every output proposition MUST pass ALL four quality gate checks above
