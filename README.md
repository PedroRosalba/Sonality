# Sonality

LLM agent with a self-evolving personality via the **Sponge architecture** — a ~500-token natural-language narrative that absorbs every conversation, modulated by an Evidence Strength Score (ESS) that gates personality updates by argument quality.

Strong logical arguments shift the agent's views. Casual chat, social pressure, and bare assertions are filtered out. Established beliefs resist change proportionally to their evidence base. Unreinforced beliefs decay over time. The result: coherent personality evolution, not random drift.

Architecture decisions grounded in 200+ academic references.

Every interaction runs **7–12 LLM calls** (5–8 synchronous, 2–4 async background):

**Synchronous (blocks response):**
1. **Query routing** — classifies query (SIMPLE/TEMPORAL/MULTI_ENTITY/AGGREGATION/BELIEF_QUERY/NONE) to select optimal retrieval strategy
2. **Listwise reranking** — LLM reorders retrieved episodes by semantic relevance to query
3. **Response generation** — core identity + personality snapshot + structured traits + retrieved memory context → response
4. **ESS classification** — evaluates *user's* argument quality (0.0–1.0); third-person framing of the agent's response prevents self-judge sycophancy bias
5. **Segment boundary detection** — event-driven detection of topic/goal shifts that triggers episode segmentation

Conditionally (when ESS reliability gates pass):

6. **Belief provenance update** — per-topic LLM assessment with AGM-style contraction handling (1–4 calls based on active topics)
7. **Insight extraction** — one-sentence personality observation extracted when evidence quality is reliable

**Async background (non-blocking):**
8. **Episodic memory storage** — LLM semantic chunking (typically 5–12 chunks per episode) + Ollama embedding for pgvector storage
9. **Semantic feature extraction** — LLM extracts persistent personality features across 4 categories (personality, preferences, knowledge, relationships); consolidates near-duplicates
10. **STM segment consolidation** — background worker periodically summarizes and consolidates episode segments

**Key implementation details:**
- **All** LLM calls (both JSON extraction and plain text generation) use `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` via `disable_thinking=True`. Without this, Qwen3.5 and similar thinking models burn their entire `max_tokens` budget (~4096 tokens, ~100 seconds) on chain-of-thought reasoning before producing output — making the system unusably slow. Applied to: main conversation response, reflection snapshot, STM summarization, consolidation summaries, ESS classification, all JSON extraction calls.
- A `threading.Semaphore(1)` serializes all LLM HTTP calls to prevent overwhelming single-threaded local inference servers.
- Synchronous LLM calls inside async coroutines use `asyncio.to_thread` to keep event loops unblocked.
- **Per-reasoning-type magnitude caps** (aligned with AGM minimal change principle): empirical_data ≤ 0.20, expert_opinion ≤ 0.14, logical_argument ≤ 0.10, anecdotal ≤ 0.06, social_pressure ≤ 0.02 per update. Prevents a single high-ESS turn from jumping opinion vectors by 0.8+.
- **Semantic feature tag validation**: each category has a fixed set of valid tags (e.g. `personality` → Communication Style, Values, Behavioral Traits, Temperament, Cognitive Style). LLM is told these in the extraction prompt, preventing cross-category tag contamination.
- **Contradiction-only feature deletion**: semantic features are never deleted due to topic shifts. The extraction prompt mandates a non-empty contradiction evidence quote in the `reason` field; the runtime guard skips any DELETE command with `reason=""`. This prevents personality erosion when users switch topics (e.g. from climate policy to cooking). Research-backed: FadeMem (2025), MemGPT, and PersonaAgent all show that topic silence ≠ trait contradiction.
- **Hybrid BM25+vector retrieval**: derivative search uses RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) of dense vector cosine similarity and sparse PostgreSQL full-text search (`tsvector` GIN index). This improves recall on exact-term queries (specific study names, statistics) where pure semantic search underperforms. Formula: `RRF(d) = Σ 1/(60 + rank_r(d))`, fusing vector and FTS ranked lists.

Periodically (every ~20 interactions): **reflection** — consolidates accumulated insights into the personality narrative, decays unreinforced beliefs, validates snapshot integrity.

2. `risk_event_trace.jsonl` — concrete hard-failure reasons
3. `health_summary_report.json` — pack-level health rollup
4. Pack trace files (`*_trace.jsonl`) — turn-level forensic detail

Decision semantics:

| Decision | Meaning | Typical next step |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | Hard gates passed with no blockers | Candidate for release |
| `pass_with_warnings` | Hard gates passed but soft blockers remain (for example budget or uncertainty-width warnings) | Review warnings and rerun targeted packs |
| `fail` | At least one hard gate failed | Investigate `risk_event_trace.jsonl`, fix, rerun |

**Thinking model support:** For models with chain-of-thought reasoning (Qwen3, Mistral-3.1, DeepSeek-R1, etc.), the system disables thinking for **all** LLM calls via `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`. Without this, thinking models exhaust their entire `max_tokens` budget (~4096 tokens, ~100 seconds) on internal chain-of-thought before producing any output — making each interaction take 5-8 minutes instead of 30-60 seconds. Applied to every `chat_completion` call site in the codebase. No configuration needed.

Runtime model overrides (no `.env` edit required):

```bash
uv run sonality --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" --ess-model "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
# or: make run ARGS='--model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" --ess-model "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"'
```

## Key Mechanisms

**Evidence Strength Score (ESS)** — classifies each user message for argument quality (0.0–1.0). Captures reasoning type (logical, empirical, anecdotal, emotional, social pressure), source reliability, novelty, and opinion direction. Third-person framing reduces sycophancy bias by up to 63.8%.

**LLM-first belief updates** — provenance, contradiction handling, contraction, confidence shifts, and decay decisions are generated by structured LLM assessments instead of static formulas.

**Dual-store memory** — every episode is written to Neo4j + pgvector derivatives, with graph edges (`SUPPORTS_BELIEF`, `CONTRADICTS_BELIEF`, temporal links, segments) and vector retrieval combined during reranked recall.

**Bootstrap dampening** — first 10 interactions get 0.5× update magnitude, preventing "first-impression dominance" from the Deffuant bounded confidence model.

**Insight accumulation** — per-interaction insights are one-sentence extractions appended to a list. Only during reflection are they consolidated into the personality narrative. This avoids the "Broken Telephone" effect where iterative LLM rewrites converge to generic text.

**Disagreement tracking with staged beliefs** — the disagreement detector checks both committed `opinion_vectors` and pending `staged_opinion_updates` to correctly identify disagreement in early interactions, before beliefs mature past the cooling period.

**Forgetting engine with recency signals** — episode forgetting candidates are evaluated with access count, last-accessed timestamp, and ESS score. High-ESS, frequently-accessed episodes are protected from archival; unaccessed trivial episodes are preferred for hard-delete. Aligned with FadeMem (2025) differential decay and A-MAC (2025) five-factor admission metrics.

**Interaction timing telemetry** — every `respond()` call logs LLM wall time and total post-processing time, enabling per-interaction throughput analysis without profiler overhead.

**Contradiction-only feature deletion guard** — semantic features resist accidental deletion when users change topics. Both the extraction prompt and a runtime guard enforce that DELETE commands require an explicit contradiction quote. Topic silence (e.g. asking about cooking while climate features exist) never triggers deletion. This prevents the "personality erosion" problem observed in MemGPT-style systems where over-deletion by LLMs is a known failure mode.

**Belief preservation monitoring** — reflection captures `opinion_vectors` before the decay step and checks for unexpected evictions after the snapshot rewrite. Only beliefs that completely disappear from `opinion_vectors` (not just from the narrative text) trigger a WARNING, eliminating false positives from the snapshot's narrative-not-enumeration design.

## Teaching Benchmark Packs

`benches/test_teaching_suite_live.py` runs an API-required end-to-end benchmark harness over scenario packs that target personality persistence and development failure modes:

By default this suite is intentionally large (60 packs / ~554 steps per replicate, with profile-driven 1–5 replicate runs), so long runtimes are expected. Use `--bench-profile rapid`/`lean` for iteration, then move to `default`/`high_assurance` when gating a release. Rapid is single-replicate signal mode; lean is fixed `n=2` signal mode. Both are treated as iteration workflows (hard-gate inconclusive outcomes are warnings instead of release blockers), so use `make bench-report-last` and `make bench-report-delta-last` to inspect trend direction before escalating. The rapid profile also applies a small ESS gate slack to reduce classifier-calibration false negatives in triage-only runs.
Each run now emits explicit isolation and memory-validity artifacts (`run_isolation_trace.jsonl`, `run_isolation_report.json`, `memory_validity_trace.jsonl`, `memory_validity_report.json`, `belief_memory_alignment_report.json`) so you can verify fresh-start execution and audit whether belief updates match contract expectations. The memory-validity and belief-alignment reports include topic-level shift rollups, making it easier to inspect whether updates stay on-topic and policy-consistent.

You can now split runs by pack groups without editing test code:

- `--bench-pack-group all` (default)
- `--bench-pack-group pulse` (ultra-fast 2-pack sanity slice: continuity + selective_revision)
- `--bench-pack-group smoke` (continuity + selective_revision + memory_structure)
- `--bench-pack-group memory`
- `--bench-pack-group personality`
- `--bench-pack-group triage` (high-signal starter slice across continuity, revision, memory, and safety)
- `--bench-pack-group safety` (safety-critical failure modes: psychosocial, poisoning, misinformation, provenance)
- `--bench-pack-group development` (personality-development core: identity, drift, revision, coherence)
- `--bench-pack-group identity` (continuity + narrative stability + cross-session identity)
- `--bench-pack-group revision` (evidence-sensitive revision + contradiction handling)
- `--bench-pack-group misinformation` (misinformation correction durability and inoculation)
- `--bench-pack-group provenance` (source memory, transfer, and provenance conflict handling)
- `--bench-pack-group bias` (cognitive/social bias resilience packs)

Or pass explicit keys with `--bench-packs key1,key2,...` (overrides pack group).
For deterministic segmentation, combine `--bench-pack-offset` and `--bench-pack-limit`
(or `BENCH_PACK_OFFSET` / `BENCH_PACK_LIMIT` in make invocations), for example:
`make bench-teaching-lean BENCH_PACK_OFFSET=8 BENCH_PACK_LIMIT=8`.
For automated chunked sweeps that stop early when quality gates fail, use
`make bench-teaching-segmented` with:
- `BENCH_SEGMENT_PROFILE` (`rapid`, `lean`, `default`, `high_assurance`)
- `BENCH_SEGMENT_SIZE` (packs per chunk)
- `BENCH_SEGMENT_MAX_SEGMENTS` (optional cap; `0` means no cap)
- `BENCH_SEGMENT_ORDER` (`declared` or `weak_first`; `weak_first` uses latest run pass-rates)
For quick targeted follow-up after any run, use:
- `make bench-select-failures-last` (prints packs with failed steps from latest run)
- `make bench-teaching-failures-last` (executes only those failed packs)
Set `BENCH_OUTPUT_ROOT` to isolate experiment cohorts (for example, `BENCH_OUTPUT_ROOT=data/teaching_bench_iter1`).
For fail-fast staging, `make bench-signal-gate-last` enforces quick thresholds from latest run:
`BENCH_SIGNAL_MIN_PACK_PASS_RATE` (default `0.85`),
`BENCH_SIGNAL_MAX_ESS_DEFAULT_RATE` (default `0.05`),
`BENCH_SIGNAL_MAX_ESS_RETRY_RATE` (default `0.15`).
Default iterate stages are now `pulse rapid hotspots-auto`; set `BENCH_ITERATE_STAGES`
explicitly when you want the longer `safety` / `development` confirmation passes.
For targeted reruns, `BENCH_HOTSPOT_PACKS` controls the pack list used by
`make bench-teaching-hotspots`.

| Category | Purpose | Representative packs |
|---|---|---|
| Identity & continuity | Preserve coherent self across sessions/time | `continuity`, `narrative_identity`, `trajectory_drift`, `long_delay_identity_consistency` |
| Evidence-sensitive revision | Resist weak pressure; revise on strong evidence | `selective_revision`, `argument_defense`, `revision_fidelity`, `epistemic_calibration` |
| Misinformation & correction durability | Hold corrections over delay and replay pressure | `misinformation_cie`, `counterfactual_recovery`, `delayed_regrounding`, `countermyth_causal_chain_consistency` |
| Source/provenance reasoning | Track source trust and provenance across domains | `source_vigilance`, `source_reputation_transfer`, `source_memory_integrity`, `provenance_conflict_arbitration` |
| Bias resilience | Stress classic cognitive/social bias failure modes | `anchoring_adjustment_resilience`, `status_quo_default_resilience`, `hindsight_certainty_resilience`, `conjunction_fallacy_probability_resilience` |
| Memory quality & safety | Validate structure, leakage, and poisoning resistance | `longmem_persistence`, `memory_structure`, `memory_leakage`, `memory_poisoning`, `psychosocial` |

Artifacts are intentionally dense for forensics and release gating:

- Core run envelope: `run_manifest.json`, `run_summary.json`
- Turn-level traces: `turn_trace.jsonl`, `ess_trace.jsonl`, `belief_delta_trace.jsonl`
- Governance and safety: `risk_event_trace.jsonl`, `stop_rule_trace.jsonl`, `judge_calibration_report.json`
- Health and operations: `health_metrics_trace.jsonl`, `health_summary_report.json`, `cost_ledger.json`
- Pack-specific traces: one `*_trace.jsonl` per benchmark pack
- Crash diagnostics: `run_error.json` (written when live runs fail before `run_summary.json`)

Scenario design is grounded in peer-reviewed work from misinformation correction, persuasion and resistance, source monitoring, long-horizon memory, narrative identity, and judgment-under-uncertainty literatures. See `docs/testing.md` for the full pack inventory and references.
