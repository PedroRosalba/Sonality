"""Composed integration benchmark scenarios (C1–C6).

Each scenario exercises multiple agent capabilities simultaneously within a
single realistic multi-turn conversation: knowledge extraction, persona
consistency, opinion formation, ESS gating, anti-sycophancy, memory recall,
belief revision, evidence accumulation, source credibility, and knowledge-
informed response generation.

Unlike isolated batteries (K1-K16 for knowledge, B1-B7 for psychology),
composed scenarios mirror real-world usage where all systems must cooperate.

Inspired by:
  - PersonaGym (2024) multi-dimensional persona evaluation
  - VitaBench (2025) cross-capability integration tasks
  - MMAU (2025) integrated understanding/reasoning/planning assessment
  - MMA (2025) evidence accumulation and reliability scoring
