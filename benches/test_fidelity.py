Rate alignment on each axis (1=completely misaligned, 5=perfectly aligned):

1. OPINION_CONSISTENCY: Does the response reflect opinions stated in the profile?
2. TONE_MATCH: Does the communication style match the profile's described tone?
3. KNOWLEDGE_GROUNDING: Does the response reference or build on the profile's stated views?
4. AUTHENTICITY: Does the response feel like it comes from this specific personality, not a generic assistant?
